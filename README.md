For most resources, the following operations are available:

- **Create**: Add new records
- **Read**: Retrieve a single record by ID
- **Update**: Modify existing records
- **Delete**: Remove records
- **Get Many**: Retrieve multiple records with basic filtering options. This operation allows you to:
  - Filter records using simple field conditions (equals)
  - Filtering on User Defined Fields (UDFs)
  - Automatically paginate through large result sets
  - Choose to get all results or limit to a specific number (1-500)
  - Set a maximum number of records to return when not retrieving all records
  - Select specific columns to return in the response
  - Add human-readable labels for picklist and reference fields
  - Flatten User-Defined Fields for easier access in workflows
- **Get Many Advanced**: Build complex queries with multiple filter conditions and logical operators. This operation provides:
  - Support for complex AND/OR logic in filters
  - Nested condition groups for sophisticated queries
  - Filtering on User Defined Fields (UDFs)
  - Advanced operators like contains, beginsWith, endsWith, exists, notExists
  - Support for IN and NOT IN operators with multiple values
  - Choose to get all results or limit to a specific number (1-500)
  - Set a maximum number of records to return when not retrieving all records
  - Select specific columns to return in the response
  - Add human-readable labels for picklist and reference fields
  - Flatten User-Defined Fields for easier access in workflows
  - Date-based filtering with automatic timezone handling
- **Count**: Get the number of matching records
- **Get Entity Info**: Retrieve metadata about the entity
- **Get Field Info**: Retrieve field definitions for the selected entity

For webhook resources (Company Webhook, Contact Webhook, Configuration Item Webhook, Ticket Webhook, Ticket Note Webhook), the following operations are available:
- **Get**: Retrieve a single webhook by ID
- **Get Many**: Retrieve multiple webhooks with basic filtering
- **Delete**: Remove a webhook

### Webhook Trigger

The node includes an Autotask Trigger node that can receive webhook events from Autotask. The trigger supports:

- Events for multiple entity types (Companies, Contacts, Tickets, Configuration Items, Ticket Notes)
- Create, Update, and Delete events
- Field selection for webhook payloads (specify which fields to include)
- Resource exclusion (exclude specific resources from triggering the workflow)
- Email notifications for webhook delivery failures
- Threshold notifications for monitoring webhook performance
- Automatic webhook registration and cleanup
- Secure payload verification with HMAC signatures

### Advanced Features

- **Resource Mapping**: Dynamically map fields based on entity definitions
- **Advanced Filtering**: Build complex queries with multiple conditions
- **Column Selection**: Choose specific fields to return in get operations
- **Picklist Label Enrichment**: Automatically add human-readable labels for picklist fields
- **Reference Label Enrichment**: Add human-readable labels for reference fields
- **UDF Flattening**: Bring user-defined fields up to the top level of response objects for easier access
- **File-based Caching**: Improved performance with persistent caching that can be shared between workflows and runs
- **Timezone Handling**: Automatic conversion between local time and UTC
- **API Usage Monitoring**: Check current API usage thresholds and limits using the API Threshold resource to help prevent hitting rate limits and ensure smooth operations

### API Threshold Resource

The API Threshold resource provides a simple way to monitor your Autotask API usage limits and current consumption. This helps users:
- Track how many API requests have been made in the current timeframe
- See the maximum allowed requests (threshold limit)
- View the usage as a percentage and categorized level (Normal, Moderate, High, Critical)
- Calculate remaining available requests
- Monitor timeframe duration for rate limits

This is particularly useful for workflows that make many API calls, allowing you to implement conditional logic based on current usage levels to avoid hitting rate limits and ensure continuous operation.

### AI Agent Playbook

This node is optimised for AI agents and tool-calling systems with specialised features designed for autonomous operation.

#### Quick Start for AI Agents

**1. Introspect Resources**
```javascript
// Discover available fields and requirements
operation: aiHelper.describeResource
params: { resource: "ticket", mode: "write" }
```

**2. Prepare Data**
```javascript
// Use JSON parameters for direct data input
bodyJson: {
  "title": "API Integration Issue", 
  "description": "Customer reporting connection problems",
  "priority": "Medium",
  "status": "New"
}
```

Note: You may provide labels for picklist/reference fields in `bodyJson` (e.g., `status: "New"`). They are automatically resolved to IDs pre-flight.

**3. Preview First (Optional)**
```javascript
// Test your request without making API calls
dryRun: true
```

**4. Execute with Optimal Output**
```javascript
// Choose output format for token efficiency
outputMode: "rawIds"        // Most efficient
outputMode: "idsAndLabels"  // Default (balanced)
outputMode: "labelsOnly"    // Most readable
```

#### AI Helper Operations

**Introspection Endpoint:**
- `aiHelper.describeResource(resource, mode)` - Get field metadata, requirements, constraints, and **entity dependencies**
- `aiHelper.listPicklistValues(resource, fieldId, query, limit, page)` - Get valid values for dropdown fields
- `aiHelper.validateParameters(resource, mode, fieldValues)` - **NEW:** Validate field values without API calls - pre-flight validation

**Dynamic Dependency Discovery:**
- **Reference fields** show what entity they link to (e.g., `companyID → company`)
- **Field dependencies** reveal required relationships (e.g., `contactID requires: companyID`)
- **Workflow guidance** provides creation order tips (e.g., "Ensure company exists before creating contact")

**Enhanced Validation:**
- **JSON Schema validation** - Immediate feedback on malformed `bodyJson`/`selectColumnsJson`
- **Parameter pre-validation** - Validate field values, types, dependencies without API calls
- **Structured error responses** - Detailed validation results with field-by-field feedback

**JSON Parameter Fallbacks:**
- `bodyJson` - Override UI mappings for write operations (create/update)
- `selectColumnsJson` - Specify fields for read operations as JSON array

**Agent-Friendly Features:**
- `outputMode` - Control response format (rawIds/idsAndLabels/labelsOnly)
- `dryRun` - Get request preview without API execution
- Smart error hints with actionable suggestions

#### Tool Configuration for Maximum Effectiveness

For optimal AI agent integration, configure multiple instances of this node as separate tools. This provides focused, reliable access to different resource types.

**Recommended Tool Setup:**

```javascript
// Tool 1: Resource Discovery and Field Introspection
{
  name: "autotask_inspector",
  description: "Discover Autotask resources, fields, and valid values",
  resource: "aiHelper",
  operations: ["describeResource", "listPicklistValues"]
}

// Tool 2: Contact Management 
{
  name: "autotask_contacts",
  description: "Read and write Autotask contacts and people",
  resource: "contact",
  operations: ["get", "getMany", "create", "update"],
  defaultParams: {
    outputMode: "idsAndLabels",
    selectColumnsJson: ["id", "firstName", "lastName", "emailAddress", "companyID", "title", "phone"]
  }
  // Accepts labels in bodyJson; labels are auto-resolved to IDs
}

// Tool 3: Company/Account Management
{
  name: "autotask_companies", 
  description: "Read and write Autotask companies and accounts",
  resource: "company",
  operations: ["get", "getMany", "create", "update"],
  defaultParams: {
    outputMode: "idsAndLabels",
    selectColumnsJson: ["id", "companyName", "companyType", "phone", "address1", "city", "state"]
  }
  // Accepts labels in bodyJson; labels are auto-resolved to IDs
}

// Tool 4: General Resource Access
{
  name: "autotask_resources",
  description: "Access any Autotask resource with full flexibility",
  allResources: true,
  defaultParams: {
    outputMode: "rawIds"  // Most token-efficient for exploratory queries
  }
  // Accepts labels in bodyJson; labels are auto-resolved to IDs
}
```

**Usage Pattern:**
1. **Start with Inspector** - Use `autotask_inspector` to understand field requirements
2. **Use Focused Tools** - Call `autotask_contacts` or `autotask_companies` for CRM related operations  
3. **Use Specialist Tools** - Use `autotask_resources` for lookups of Autotask MSP staff (resources)

**Benefits:**
- **Faster execution** - Pre-configured tools reduce parameter complexity
- **Better reliability** - Focused tools have predictable schemas
- **Token efficiency** - Default parameters optimised for each use case
- **Easier debugging** - Clear separation of concerns

#### Environment Setup

For AI tool usage, set this environment variable:

```bash
N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
```

Configuration options:
- Add to your `.env` file
- Set in system environment variables  
- Include in Docker/container configuration
- Add to startup command: `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true n8n start`

#### Example Agent Workflow

**Scenario: Create a contact for a new company**

```javascript
// 1. Inspect contact requirements using dedicated tool
autotask_inspector.call({
  operation: "describeResource",
  targetResource: "contact", 
  mode: "write"
})
// Returns: { 
//   fields: [
//     { id: "companyID", required: true, isReference: true, referencesEntity: "company" },
//     { id: "firstName", required: true, type: "string" },
//     { id: "lastName", required: true, type: "string" }
//   ],
//   notes: [
//     "Required fields for write: companyID, firstName, lastName",
//     "Reference fields (must reference existing entities): companyID → company",
//     "Workflow tip: Ensure referenced company exists before creating contact."
//   ]
// }

// 2. Check company picklist values if needed
autotask_inspector.call({
  operation: "listPicklistValues",
  targetResource: "contact",
  fieldId: "companyID",
  query: "Tech Solutions"  // Search for company
})

// 2.5. Validate parameters before creation (NEW!)
autotask_inspector.call({
  operation: "validateParameters",
  targetResource: "contact",
  mode: "create",
  fieldValues: {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "emailAddress": "john.smith@techsolutions.com",
    "companyID": 12345,
    "title": "IT Manager"
  }
})
// Returns: {
//   isValid: true,
//   errors: [],
//   warnings: [
//     { field: "companyID", message: "Reference field 'companyID' points to company. Ensure the referenced record exists.", code: "REFERENCE_EXISTENCE_CHECK" }
//   ],
//   summary: { totalFields: 15, providedFields: 5, validFields: 5, requiredFieldsMissing: 0, invalidValues: 0 }
// }

// 3. Create contact using focused tool
autotask_contacts.call({
  operation: "create",
  bodyJson: {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith", 
    "emailAddress": "john.smith@techsolutions.com",
    "companyID": 12345,
    "title": "IT Manager"
  },
  dryRun: true  // Preview first
})
// Dry-run response includes a `resolutions` array when labels were resolved to IDs, e.g.:
// resolutions: [{ field: 'status', from: 'New', to: 1, method: 'picklist' }]

// 4. Execute after validation
autotask_contacts.call({
  operation: "create",
  bodyJson: { /* same data */ },
  outputMode: "idsAndLabels"
})

// 5. Retrieve company details using focused tool  
autotask_companies.call({
  operation: "get",
  id: 12345
})
```

#### Error Self-Healing

Errors include structured hints to help agents self-correct:

```javascript
// Error response includes actionable guidance
{
  "error": "Field 'priority' has invalid value 'Urgent'",
  "extensions": {
    "hint": "Use aiHelper.listPicklistValues('ticket', 'priority') to get valid options, then retry with a valid value.",
    "suggestions": [
      "Get valid values: aiHelper.listPicklistValues('ticket', 'priority')",
      "Use exact values from the picklist response"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Best Practices for Agents

- **Configure focused tools** - Set up separate tools for inspector, contacts, companies, and general resources
- **Start with inspection** - Always call `autotask_inspector.describeResource` first to understand field requirements
- **Use focused tools** - Prefer `autotask_contacts` or `autotask_companies` over general tools for better reliability
- **Validate before execution** - Use `autotask_inspector.validateParameters` for pre-flight validation to catch errors early
- **Optimise responses** - Use `selectColumnsJson` to reduce payload size and `outputMode: "rawIds"` for token efficiency
- **Double-check with dry-run** - Use `dryRun: true` to preview requests before execution, especially for write operations
- **Handle errors smartly** - Follow the structured hints in error responses for self-correction
- **Cache discoveries** - Store field metadata and picklist values to avoid repeated introspection calls
- **JSON validation** - Invalid JSON in `bodyJson`/`selectColumnsJson` is caught immediately with helpful error messages

#### Troubleshooting

**Tool Not Available:** Ensure `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true` is set
**No Parameters Visible:** Call `aiHelper.describeResource` to inspect available fields
**Large Responses:** Use `selectColumnsJson` and `outputMode: "rawIds"` for efficiency
**Validation Errors:** Follow error hints to resolve field requirement issues

   - Toggle "Get All" to false and set "Max Records" (1-500) to limit the results
6. Connect to a trigger or previous node
7. Execute the workflow

### Advanced Example: Using Column Selection and Reference Labels

1. Add an **Autotask** node to your workflow
2. Select **Ticket** as the resource
3. Select **Get Many** as the operation
4. Add filter conditions as needed
5. Enable **Select Columns** to choose specific fields to return

8. Enable **Add Reference Labels** to get human-readable values for reference fields
9. Enable **Flatten User-Defined Fields** to bring UDFs to the top level of response objects
10. Execute the workflow to get tickets with only the selected fields and human-readable labels

### Advanced Example: Complex Filtering with Get Many Advanced

1. Add an **Autotask** node to your workflow
2. Select **Ticket** as the resource
3. Select **Get Many Advanced** as the operation
4. Build a complex filter, for example:
   ```json
   {
      "filter": [
      {
        "op": "and",
        "items": [
          {
            "field": "status",
            "op": "noteq",
            "value": 5
          },
          {
            "op": "or",
            "items": [
              {
                "field": "priority",
                "op": "eq",
                "value": 6
              },
              {
                "field": "dueDateTime",
                "op": "lt",
                "value": "{{ $now.plus(3, 'days').toLocal()}}"
              }
             ]
           }
         ]
      }
    ]
   }
   ```
   [Valid filter operators and filter documentation can be found here](https://ww15.autotask.net/help/DeveloperHelp/Content/APIs/REST/API_Calls/REST_Basic_Query_Calls.htm?Highlight=filter#List2)
5. Choose whether to retrieve all results or limit the number:
   - Toggle "Get All" to true to retrieve all matching records
   - Toggle "Get All" to false and set "Max Records" (1-500) to limit the results
6. Enable **Select Columns** to choose specific fields to return
7. Enable **Add Reference Labels** and **Add Picklist Labels** for human-readable values
8. Execute the workflow to retrieve tickets that are not complete AND either have priority 6 OR are due within the next 3 days

### Example: Monitoring API Usage with API Threshold

1. Add an **Autotask** node to your workflow
2. Select **API Threshold** as the resource
3. The operation **Get API Usage** will be automatically selected (it's the only available operation)
4. Execute the node to receive current API usage information including:
   - Current usage count
   - Maximum threshold (limit)
   - Usage percentage
   - Usage level (Normal, Moderate, High, Critical)
   - Remaining requests
   - Timeframe duration
5. You can use this information with IF nodes to implement conditional logic:
   - Pause workflows when usage is too high
   - Throttle requests during peak usage periods
   - Log warnings when approaching limits
   - Only execute non-critical operations when usage is below certain thresholds

### Advanced Example: Working with Parent-Child Relationships

Many Autotask entities have parent-child relationships (e.g., Companies and Contacts). To work with these:

1. First, retrieve or create the parent entity
2. Use the parent entity's ID in the child entity operations
3. For example, to create a Contact for a Company:
   - First node: Get or create the Company
   - Second node: Create a Contact with the Company ID

### Example: Setting Up a Webhook Trigger

1. Add an **Autotask Trigger** node to your workflow
2. Select the entity type to monitor (Companies, Contacts, Tickets, etc.)
3. Select the events to subscribe to (Create, Update, Delete)
4. Configure the webhook URL (n8n will handle this automatically)
5. Optionally specify fields to include in the webhook payload
6. Optionally exclude specific resources from triggering the workflow
7. Configure email notifications for webhook delivery failures if needed
8. Save and activate the workflow
9. The node will automatically register the webhook with Autotask
10. When events occur in Autotask, they will trigger your workflow
11. When the workflow is deactivated, the webhook will be automatically removed

## Configuration

### Caching Options

The node includes an enhanced file-based caching system to improve performance by reducing API calls:

- **Enable Field Caching**: Toggle caching on/off
- **Cache TTL**: How long to cache field values (in seconds)
- **Cache Entity Info**: Whether to cache entity information and field definitions
- **Entity Info TTL**: How long to cache entity information
- **Cache Reference Fields**: Whether to cache reference field values
- **Reference Fields TTL**: How long to cache reference field values
- **Cache Picklists**: Whether to cache picklist values
- **Picklists TTL**: How long to cache picklist values
- **File-based Cache**: Cache is stored in files that can be shared between workflows and runs
- **Cache Directory**: Optional path to a directory where cache files will be stored

> **IMPORTANT**: This node uses dynamic picklists and field enrichers to convert numerical values into human-readable labels through dynamic lookups. It's strongly recommended to keep caching enabled to avoid excessive API calls. Without caching, each picklist and reference field lookup requires separate API calls, which can quickly consume your API rate limits, especially in workflows with many operations or large data sets.

### Label Enrichment and Field Processing

The node provides options to enrich entities with human-readable labels and simplify field access:

- **Add Picklist Labels**: Adds "_label" fields for picklist values (e.g., Status_label: "In Progress")
- **Add Reference Labels**: Adds "_label" fields for reference values (e.g., Company_label: "Acme Corporation")
- **Flatten User-Defined Fields**: When enabled, brings UDFs up to the top level of each response object for easier access instead of being nested in the userDefinedFields array (maintains the original array for backward compatibility)

### Column Selection

To improve performance and reduce payload size, you can select specific columns to return:

- **Select Columns**: Choose which fields to include in the response
- Works with all get operations (get, getMany, getManyAdvanced)
- Compatible with label enrichment features

### Timezone Handling

All dates and times in the Autotask API are in UTC. The node automatically converts between your selected timezone and UTC:

- When creating or updating records, local times are converted to UTC
- When retrieving records, UTC times are converted to your local timezone
- The timezone is configured in the credentials
- For Search Filter operations, input dates are thoroughly converted to UTC using the configured timezone, ensuring consistency with API requirements
- Output dates from all operations are converted to the configured local timezone for easier workflow handling

## Limitations

### API Limits

- Maximum 500 records per page in query results
- Maximum 50 pages per query operation
- Maximum 500 OR conditions in filters
- Maximum 1 User Defined Field per query

### Entity-Specific Limitations

- Some entities may not support all operations (e.g., Project Phases cannot be deleted)
- Parent-child relationships require specific handling
- Some fields may be read-only or have specific validation rules

### Performance Considerations

- Large queries may be slow and should be optimised with filters
- Column selection can significantly improve performance by reducing payload size
- Complex workflows with many API calls may hit rate limits
- Disabling caching when using picklist or reference label enrichment can lead to a high volume of API calls, potentially triggering rate limits. Each field being enriched requires a separate API call when cache is not available.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Authentication Errors**: Verify your API credentials and ensure the API user has appropriate permissions
- **Field Validation Errors**: Check field requirements in the Autotask API documentation
- **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter rate limiting, reduce the frequency of API calls or implement retry logic
