# Changelog

All notable changes to the n8n-nodes-autotask project will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.6] - 2025-08-17

### Added
- **AI Agent-Friendly Improvements**: Comprehensive enhancements for AI/tool-calling systems including:
  - **AI Helper Resource**: New `aiHelper` resource with `describeResource`, `listPicklistValues`, and `validateParameters` operations for runtime introspection
  - **JSON Parameter Fallbacks**: `bodyJson` and `selectColumnsJson` parameters to override UI mappings with structured JSON input
  - **Output Modes**: `rawIds`, `idsAndLabels`, `labelsOnly` options for token-efficient responses  
  - **Dry-Run Support**: Request preview functionality across all operations without API execution
  - **Dynamic Dependency Discovery**: Automatic entity relationship mapping and field dependency detection
  - **JSON Schema Validation**: Immediate feedback on malformed JSON parameters
  - **Enhanced Error Hints**: Structured error responses with actionable suggestions for AI self-correction
  - **Agent Playbook Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for AI agent integration and best practices
  - **Label-to-ID Resolution on Writes**: `bodyJson` can now accept picklist/reference labels; values are pre-flight resolved to IDs using introspection and lookups
  - **Reference Alias Tolerance**: Improved reference detection to accept common variants/typos (e.g. `resrouce`, `assignedresource`, `accountManager`, `account_manager`) and map them correctly

### Changed
- **Consistent Output Shaping**: Applied `outputMode` processing to create/update responses for consistency with read operations
- **Agent Hints (Read Ops)**: Expanded agent-friendly hints in read paths (e.g. empty/invalid responses) to aid self-correction

## [0.9.5] - 2025-08-11

### Changed
- Resolved merge conflicts and bumped version to 0.9.5. Preserved all changes from 0.9.3 and 0.9.4.

## [0.9.4] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where Assets (Configurtion items) Webhook errored with "Invalid entity type. Received InstalledProduct, expected ConfigurationItems."

## [0.9.3] - 2025-08-07

### Added
- Added support for CompanySiteConfigurations endpoint support for:
  - **Update**: Modify site configuration settings and user-defined fields for customer companies
  - **Get**: Retrieve individual site configuration by ID
  - **Get Many**: Query multiple site configurations with filtering support
  - **Count**: Count site configurations matching specific criteria
  - **Entity Info**: Access field definitions and metadata
  - Full User-Defined Fields (UDF) support with Protected Data Permissions (DPP) compliance
  - Parent-child relationship support with Companies entity

## [0.9.2] - 2025-07-31

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where UDFs selected in the resource mapper for `Get Many` and `Count` operations were not being correctly identified, causing API errors.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-07-23

### Changed
- Increased maximum page count from 50 to 1000
- Refactored pagination to use iterative loops instead of recursion for large data sets.

### Fixed

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-10

### Fixed
- Enhanced date/time handling in Search Filter's Build and Dynamic Build operation, building on v0.8.9 fix: now thoroughly converts input and output dates consistently between timezones using credentials' configured timezone, ensuring all dates sent to Autotask API are in UTC as required.

## [0.8.9] - 2025-07-10

### Fixed
- Prevented double UTC conversion for date values in the Search Filter's Dynamic Build operation.

## [0.8.8] - 2025-07-05

### Changed
- Performance improvement for getMany operations: reference and picklist enrichment now fetches only required entities, not all.

## [0.8.7] - 2025-07-05
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where reference fields were exclusively enriched from active records; now supports enrichment from inactive records when required. Additionally, ensured that display fields for inactive reference records are properly retrieved for accurate label generation (e.g., resource names instead of "Resource #ID") by ensuring correct ID type handling during lookup. Picklists continue to be populated from active records only.

## [0.8.5] - 2025-07-01
### Changed
- Performance: Continued UI-performance tuning for large workflows â€“ the "Select Columns" dropdown now renders **only** the fields you pick (`showOnlySelected`) and includes in-dropdown search capabilities.  This further reduces DOM load and improves NDV responsiveness when hundreds of Autotask fields are available.

## [0.8.4] - 2025-06-30
### Changed
- Performance: Introduced provisional in-memory memoisation and pick-list trimming for the "Select Columns" dropdown as part of ongoing UI-performance tuning for larger workflows.

## [0.8.3] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- Added support for `Countries` entity to enable `CountryID` reference field enrichment.

### Changed
- Modified the display name format for several reference fields to provide a cleaner and more consistent UI:
  - **Resource**: Changed from `FirstName LastName [Email] [ID]` to `FirstName LastName`.
  - **Contact**: Changed from `FirstName LastName [Email]` to `FirstName LastName`.
  - **Ticket**: Changed from `TicketNumber - Title` to `Title [TicketNumber]`.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-05-24
