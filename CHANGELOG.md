## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-03

### Added
- **Enhanced AI Tool Effectiveness**: Major improvements to Tool and AI Helper resources for n8n AI node compatibility
  - **Static Tool Surface**: Added `TOOL_OPERATION_OPTIONS` with all 100+ resource-operation combinations for immediate AI enumeration
  - **Capability Discovery**: New `listCapabilities` operation in AI Helper for comprehensive API introspection
  - **Proactive Validation**: Automatic parameter validation for create/update operations with helpful error guidance
  - **Safety Gates**: Configurable restrictions with `allowWriteOperations`, `allowDryRunForWrites`, and `allowedResourcesJson`
  - **Enhanced Hints**: Proactive parameter hints pointing to appropriate AI Helper functions
  - **AI Resource Discoverability**: Removed `displayOptions.show.resource` gating for Tool and AI Helper resources

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Tool Resource**: Redesigned with simple string/JSON parameters for AI Node compatibility
- **Tool > Execute safety gating**: Centralised enforcement for:
  - `Allow Write Operations` (default false) blocks create/update/delete unless explicitly enabled
  - `Allow Dry Run for Writes` (default true) permits dry-run previews when writes are blocked
  - `Allowed Resources (JSON)` restricts execution to an allow-list (case-insensitive)
  - `Dry Run` returns structured previews without calling the API

### Fixed
- **Delete dry-run behaviour**: 
  - Tool > Execute now returns a structured delete preview when `dryRun` is enabled instead of executing the request
  - Base delete operation respects `dryRun` and no longer issues DELETE requests when enabled
- **AI Helper resource picklists**: Fixed AI Helper resource name fields to display as proper dropdown picklists instead of empty autocomplete inputs by changing field type from 'string' to 'options'
- **AI Helper List Picklist Values**: Enhanced operation with parameter validation, improved UDF field detection, better error handling with helpful messages, and enriched response metadata including pagination info and field details
- **Fixed AI parameter isolation**: Prevented AI-specific `selectColumnsJson` parameter from interfering with regular resource mapper picklist loading
- **Resource Mapper Manual Mode**: Fixed auto-population of fields in "map each column manually" mode across all resources

## [0.9.9] - 2025-09-01

### Added
- Added support for Billing items resources
 - Invoice special endpoints:
   - Get PDF: download invoice as a PDF (`InvoicePDF`)
   - Get Markup (HTML): retrieve invoice markup (`InvoiceMarkupHtml`)
   - Get Markup (XML): retrieve invoice markup (`InvoiceMarkupXML`)
   - Exposed as new operations on the Invoice resource; responses are returned as binary data with `fileName` and `contentType` for downstream use


## [0.9.8] - 2025-08-29

### Added
- Added support for Subscription and Subscription Periods resources


## [0.9.7] - 2025-08-24

### Changed
- Updated AI Helper and Tool resources to better align with AI Agent node operational requirements
- Removed AI centric inputs from all resoruces other than AI Helper and Tool resource


## [0.9.6] - 2025-08-17

### Added
- **AI Agent-Friendly Improvements**: Comprehensive enhancements for AI/tool-calling systems including:
  - **AI Helper Resource**: New `aiHelper` resource with `describeResource`, `listPicklistValues`, and `validateParameters` operations for runtime introspection
  - **JSON Parameter Fallbacks**: `bodyJson` and `selectColumnsJson` parameters to override UI mappings with structured JSON input
  - **Output Modes**: `rawIds`, `idsAndLabels`, `labelsOnly` options for token-efficient responses  
  - **Dry-Run Support**: Request preview functionality across all operations without API execution
  - **Dynamic Dependency Discovery**: Automatic entity relationship mapping and field dependency detection
  - **JSON Schema Validation**: Immediate feedback on malformed JSON parameters
  - **Enhanced Error Hints**: Structured error responses with actionable suggestions for AI self-correction
  - **Agent Playbook Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for AI agent integration and best practices
  - **Label-to-ID Resolution on Writes**: `bodyJson` can now accept picklist/reference labels; values are pre-flight resolved to IDs using introspection and lookups
  - **Reference Alias Tolerance**: Improved reference detection to accept common variants/typos (e.g. `resrouce`, `assignedresource`, `accountManager`, `account_manager`) and map them correctly

### Changed
- **Consistent Output Shaping**: Applied `outputMode` processing to create/update responses for consistency with read operations
- **Agent Hints (Read Ops)**: Expanded agent-friendly hints in read paths (e.g. empty/invalid responses) to aid self-correction

## [0.9.5] - 2025-08-11

### Changed
- Resolved merge conflicts and bumped version to 0.9.5. Preserved all changes from 0.9.3 and 0.9.4.

## [0.9.4] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where Assets (Configurtion items) Webhook errored with "Invalid entity type. Received InstalledProduct, expected ConfigurationItems."

## [0.9.3] - 2025-08-07

### Added
- Added support for CompanySiteConfigurations endpoint support for:
  - **Update**: Modify site configuration settings and user-defined fields for customer companies

## [0.9.2] - 2025-07-31

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where UDFs selected in the resource mapper for `Get Many` and `Count` operations were not being correctly identified, causing API errors.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-07-23

### Changed
- Increased maximum page count from 50 to 1000
- Refactored pagination to use iterative loops instead of recursion for large data sets.

### Fixed

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-10

### Fixed
- Enhanced date/time handling in Search Filter's Build and Dynamic Build operation, building on v0.8.9 fix: now thoroughly converts input and output dates consistently between timezones using credentials' configured timezone, ensuring all dates sent to Autotask API are in UTC as required.

## [0.8.9] - 2025-07-10

### Fixed
- Prevented double UTC conversion for date values in the Search Filter's Dynamic Build operation.

## [0.8.8] - 2025-07-05

### Changed
- Performance improvement for getMany operations: reference and picklist enrichment now fetches only required entities, not all.

## [0.8.7] - 2025-07-05
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where reference fields were exclusively enriched from active records; now supports enrichment from inactive records when required. Additionally, ensured that display fields for inactive reference records are properly retrieved for accurate label generation (e.g., resource names instead of "Resource #ID") by ensuring correct ID type handling during lookup. Picklists continue to be populated from active records only.

## [0.8.5] - 2025-07-01
### Changed
- Performance: Continued UI-performance tuning for large workflows â€“ the "Select Columns" dropdown now renders **only** the fields you pick (`showOnlySelected`) and includes in-dropdown search capabilities.  This further reduces DOM load and improves NDV responsiveness when hundreds of Autotask fields are available.

## [0.8.4] - 2025-06-30
### Changed
- Performance: Introduced provisional in-memory memoisation and pick-list trimming for the "Select Columns" dropdown as part of ongoing UI-performance tuning for larger workflows.

## [0.8.3] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- Added support for `Countries` entity to enable `CountryID` reference field enrichment.

### Changed
- Modified the display name format for several reference fields to provide a cleaner and more consistent UI:
  - **Resource**: Changed from `FirstName LastName [Email] [ID]` to `FirstName LastName`.
  - **Contact**: Changed from `FirstName LastName [Email]` to `FirstName LastName`.
  - **Ticket**: Changed from `TicketNumber - Title` to `Title [TicketNumber]`.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-05-24
